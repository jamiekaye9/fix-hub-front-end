# FIX HUB

![Fix Hub Logo](/src/assets/Images/fix-hub-logo-background.png)

This is an IT ticketing application, giving users the functionality to create, read, update and delete IT tickets. Within tickets, users also have the ability to create, read, update and delete comments. This idea came from my experience using applications like ServiceNow as well the functionality being in use at most companies worldwide.

### Attributions
I used Recharts to create the chart functionality on the Dashboard page.

### Technologies Used
JavaScript, JSX, React, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, JWT and Bcrypt.

### Next Steps
I would like to enhance this application, so that a User can create or join a company that holds company exclusive tickets. This would allow individual companies to use the app. I would also like to create a separate reporting page that contains reports specific to the user's activity in the app.
